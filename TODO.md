# TODO

You are going to make an application that allows you to capture your favorite movie and share this information with all your classmates.

- The API is available at the following URL: https://post-a-form.herokuapp.com/api/movies

- The application should include :

- A form with 3 mandatory fields:

- A text field to enter the name of the movie.

- A text field to enter a URL corresponding to the movie poster.

- A field textarea allowing you to enter a comment (why do you like this movie? what made you stand out? etc.).

- A button to send the form.

- A message will be displayed when the movie has been successfully added.

- Commit and push it to GitHub at the end, and post the repository link.
